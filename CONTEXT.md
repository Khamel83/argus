## Glossary

### RRF Score Attribution

Per-result attribution that decomposes a fused Reciprocal Rank Fusion score into
the providers that returned that result. Because RRF is additive, each provider's
attribution is its own rank contribution to the final score.

This is narrower than the broader attribution program, which may later include
provider value attribution, routing decision attribution, extraction chain
attribution, or session context attribution.

### Topology awareness

Argus distinguishes between **datacenter** and **residential** egress. Some
providers (notably scraped Yahoo and a handful of extraction targets) are
unreliable from datacenter IPs but work fine from residential ones. The
`ARGUS_EGRESS_TYPE` and `ARGUS_RESIDENTIAL_POLICY` settings tell Argus where
it is and how aggressively to prefer residential workers. See the
**Configuration** section of [README.md](README.md).

### Adaptive Domain Memory

A small SQLite table that records, per domain, whether datacenter extraction has
historically failed. Future extractions for that domain are routed to a
residential worker first instead of paying the failure cost again. Lives in
`argus/extraction/`.

### Provenance

Every `SearchResult` and `ExtractedContent` carries `egress` (residential or
datacenter), `machine` (the hostname that performed the fetch), and
`source_type` (search, extract, recover, etc.). The HTTP, CLI, and MCP surfaces
all expose these fields so downstream consumers can audit where a result came
from.
